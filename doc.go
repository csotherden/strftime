// Package strftime provides functionality for formatting time based on the C strftime(3) function. http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/strftime.3.html
//
// The Go standard library time package uses layout strings based on the reference time Mon Jan 2 15:04:05 MST 2006
// (AKA 01/02 03:04:05PM â€˜06 -0700). The purpose of the strftime package is not to replace the time package layout
// based formatting or encourage Go developers to punt on learning to use the reference time. Instead this package
// exists for those cases where it's necessary to use strftime conversion specifications, such as when receiving
// timestamps from non Go systems which provide a format description using strftime conventions.
//
// Conversion Specifications
//
// This package attempts to comply with the C strftime(3) function closely as reasonably possible. The format
// specification strings contain special character sequences called conversion specifications. Conversion specifications
// are prefixed by the % character. At this time all conversion specifications are supported with the exception of
// modifiers.
//
// Localization
//
// Support for localization is currently mixed. Conversion specifications for individual time fields should be fully
// localized. However, conversion specifications that map to different timestamps formats depending on locale (for
// example %c, %x, and %X) only support the en_US localization.
